This repository contains an experimental script (main.py) which prompts OpenAI GPT-4 to generate a containerlabs network topology with a simulated BGP failure.

Once the router configurations / clab definition has been generated, the containerlab topology is created and a chat is opened to guide the student towards resolving the BGP issue.
